 Installation Instructions
===========================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Read this if you DO NOT have shell access to the web space (or do not
know what this means).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1). Download the .tar file to a location on your PC.
2). Untar the file (Winzip can handle this) on your PC.
3). Load up your favourite FTP client, and connect to your web hosting
    space.
4). Upload the files you untarred to the desired location in your web
    hosting area (for example /www/news or /docs/news or something similar, consult
    your web host for further assistance). 
    
*** You can place these files anywhere within your web hosting space as long as they
    remain intact as they were in the archive (this means the files in db/ have to be
    placed in db/ wherever you install this to).
    
For example:

My forum is located at http://www.mydomain.com/forum/
My forum website files are located in /www/forum/ in my web hosting space.
I want to display the forum news information in my main website news page which is
http://www.mydomain.com/news.php so I choose to install the files in /www on my web space.

Proceed to step 5)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Read this if you DO have shell access to your web space
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1). Download the .tar file to a location in your shell 
    (wget http://flimflam.homelinux.org/projects/forumnews/forumnews.tar)
2). Make the directory and/or ensure that the archive is in the correct desired location for installation.
3). Untar the archive (tar -xvf forumnews.tar)
4). This step doesn't really exist - it's not here, you never read it - in fact, there is no Step 4 ;)

Proceed to step 5)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All users read this:-

5). Once the files are uploaded, you can edit the file you want the forum posts to appear in
    with the following text:- (* Note this has to be a PHP file).
    
    <? include("forumnews.php"); ?>
    
6). You should be ready to go :) If you encounter any issues, or have any questions or comments
    related to this utility, please send them either to me (Phil Barbier) at coder@seepies.net or
    post them at my forum: http://www.seepies.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=4

===========================
 Configuring the utility
===========================

Configuration is a relatively trivial matter, the config.php file is the only file you are required
to edit, and the options therein are straightforward to follow.

Once you have made the appropriate changes to the config.php file then upload/copy the file to the area
where you installed the script for the changes to take place.

If you do not know the answers to some of the more advanced questions, then leave them at default.
If the defaults do not work, either contact your web host technical support, or if you prefer an
answer within a smaller timeframe, post a question on the forum:-
http://www.seepies.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=4

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===========================
 Layout of the script
===========================

With web design and layout being so diverse, I've not bothered to make the default layout or look
anything special. However, I have put the information within self-contained tables (<table> tags)
so that it ought to be easier to include into your page. If you want to juggle the information around
and make it fit into your site design, then go right ahead, if you could send me a URL so I can see
it in action, that'd be great too :)

 Notes
===========================

The coding team is currently only myself, so please expect to wait for replies on the forum.
Any updates/support/issues can be dealt with on the forum, so that the community can benefit. I will
try my best to get things attended to in a timely manner.
